#  Hi there! I'm Tim

I'm a passionate software developer with interests in AI, web technologies.

I'm currently focusing on:
- Building Workflows using KNIME, The purpose of this project is to fetch and preprocess weather data from multiple SMHI weather stations and join it with SCB energy production data in order to visualize their relationships and perform clustering on monthly aggregated values.
- Exploring NLP and machine learning
- Creating my own Genetic Algorithms to optimize the Travelling Salesman Problem

##  Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:
- [Genetic Algorithm solving Travelling Salesman Problems](https://github.com/Pellikaaan/TravelingSalesmanProblem.git) – School work for an assignment.
- [Testing-Cyber-Physical-Systems](https://github.com/Pellikaaan/Testing-Cyber-physical-Systems-Using-NLP-Models-thesis-work-) – A Testing framework using NLP-models to test cyber-physical systems
- [Machine Learning Regression in KNIME](https://github.com/Pellikaaan/ml-knime-project) - A full KNIME workflow performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and 10-fold cross-validated comparison of three regression models on the California Housing dataset.
